# Module 08: Writing automated tests for real scenarios

## Preparation:

Students need to prepare 3 to 5 real-world test scenarios.
These scenarios need to be defined in enough details so that it is
evident what actions need to be executed and how the resulting conditions
will be tested!


## Tasks

Students will discuss their chosen scenarios with instructor and ask
any particular questions they may have. For example how to get the
children nodes of a particular web element, etc. Students will then implement
their scenarios one by one (starting from the easiest one where possible).
Instructor will examing their work and provide feedback.
