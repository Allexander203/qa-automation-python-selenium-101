# Python training for Myriad Development

## Session 00 - Environment setup

Students need to prepare the following environment on their computers:

* Install Python on Windows from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/;
 * TODO: which version: 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6 ?
* Text editor of choice, preferably [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/);
* Install & configure source control system of choice (or git).

**NOTES:** 

* Students should be prepared before the first session since the
training does not intend to focus on installation related issues.
* Students must be familiar with their tools of choice, e.g. they need to know
how to use the IDE or text editor, how to search files, how to search for
particular text, etc.
* Instructor may be using different text editor and operating system and may not be
able to help with matters related to any particular tool if they are not obvious
enough!
* Students are advised to use the same tools so they can help each other.
Preferably the same tools are used inside the company as well.
* Student must read all preparation materials before class begins;
* Each session begins with review of homework from previous session;
* Classes will explain the theory from the preparation section with examples
and focus on writing programs to solidify the knowledge;
* Next session will not start until all pending homework tasks are complete!
* If necessary sessions will be repeated!
